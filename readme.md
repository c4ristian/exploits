# Analysis of the Exploit-DB

## What is it?
This library provides [notebooks](./notebooks) to analyse a snapshot of the [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/). 
The snapshot was retrieved from [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/tools/exploitdb/) and transformed
with the script [execute_transformer](notebooks/_backup/execute_transformer.py). Time of transformation 
as well as the snapshot date are documented in the file [timestamps](./data/timestamps.txt). 
The snapshot is stored as a [CSV&nbsp;file](./data/files_exploits_transformed.csv). For a description 
of how to update it see below.
